# Abstract website help page recreation (Frontend Practice)

a responsive front-end recreation of the [Abstract](https://help.goabstract.com/hc/en-us) website help page. this is a self-directed challenge from [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/abstract) to improve my layout, design, and vanilla javascript skills. also, because it's fun.

## 📌 about the project

this is a **pure front-end project**: no frameworks, libraries, or build tools. just pure **html**, **css**, and **javascript**. 🙃
