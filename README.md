# Abstract website help page recreation (Frontend Practice)

A responsive front-end recreation of the [Abstract](https://help.goabstract.com/hc/en-us) website help page. This is a self-directed challenge from [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/abstract) to improve my layout, design, and vanilla JavaScript skills. Also, because it's fun.
